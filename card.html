			<p class="interesting">Zebras have four gaits: walk, trot, canter and gallop. They are generally slower than horses, but their great stamina helps them outrun predators. 
				When chased, a zebra will zig-zag from side to side, making it more difficult for the predator to attack. 
				When cornered, the zebra will rear up and kick or bite its attacker.</p>

			<p class="description">Zebras are several species of African equids (horse family) united by their distinctive black and white striped coats. 
				Their stripes come in different patterns, unique to each individual. 
				They are generally social animals that live in small harems to large herds. Unlike their closest relatives, horses and donkeys, zebras have never been truly domesticated.
